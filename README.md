# Woodpecker CI Slack Plugin

Forked for Docker Publish and GH-Action Build

Use in `.woodpecker.yaml` as follows:

```yaml
slack-failure:
    image: rtuszik/woodpecker-slack:latest
    pull: true
    settings:
        status: failure
        description: <description of your service or system>
        webhook:
            from_secret: slack_webhook
    when:
        status: failure

slack-release:
    image: rtuszik/woodpecker-slack:latest
    pull: true
    settings:
        status: success
        description: <description of your service or system>
        webhook:
            from_secret: slack_webhook
    when:
        event: push
        branch: <main branch, usually master>
        status: success
```

This ensures that a message is posted if a pull request or master commit fails and also that a message is posted if master succeeds and a new version is deployed.

## Build

Build the binary with the following commands:

```
mise build
```

This will produce a file called `drone-slack` in your root directory.

## Docker

Build the Docker image and test-run it:

```
mise docker:run
```

This will produce docker image `gowerstreet/slack:local` and run it with a few test variables. You should be able to see the output in the `#alerts` slack channel.
